Task 4 - Scenario Walkthrough

Suppose John is an international student currently in his second year at UofT. He lives in a shared apartment with two other people. John is finding it difficult to keep track of all his expenses so he looks for money management solutions and stumbles upon our app. He also tells his roommates about the app and creates a group for splitting shared expenses such as groceries.

John also used the app to split expenses with just one other person. When John goes out with his friend Jack for lunch, John creates a temporary group with Jack and Jack pays the $50 bill and adds the expense on our app, splitting it with John. John’s new balance will reflect that he now owes Jack $25 more than he originally did. Similarly, Jack’s new balance will reflect that he is now owed $25 more (or he owes John $25 less depending on the previous balance) by John. Every user can check their total balance that they owe and are owed on the Dashboard.
